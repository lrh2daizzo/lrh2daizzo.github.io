So for this project it took me a long time to decide what to use as my domain, ultimately I kept it simple and decided to make an app that allows you to CRUD(create,read,update,delete)  goals. I used the corneal gem to start out, but had to changup the database connection bc of the changes made by ActiveRecord update. I found sinatra to not be too difficult to use and it was definetly exciting and rewarding to create a functioning app with a database! What I liked most about the whole process of making a dynamic app was creating models and databases using ActiveRecord. I definetly want to improve in my design skils and get better at css. Overall I enjoyed the process but found myself repeating a lot of lines of code for each route and all my controllers. I am excited to keep improving and learning more!
